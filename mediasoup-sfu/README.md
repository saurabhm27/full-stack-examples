You can find the integration code snippets in the following components:

 * [Monitor](src/Monitor.ts): config a monitor and analyse the stats.
 * [Server](src/Server.ts): check how monitor is connected to the observer
 * [Client](src/Client.ts): add transport to the monitor

You can also just search for `-- ObserveRTC integration --` comment in the whole project.
